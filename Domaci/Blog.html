		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>
			Hello everyone and welcome to my blog.
		</p>
		<p>
			I’m <strong><em>Tijana</em></strong>. I was born in Loznica (west Serbia). After I finished high school I moved to Novi Sad where I studied architecture at the Faculty of Technical Sciences.
		</p>
		<p>
			Besides architecture, I became very passionate about web development. I have a curious mind so I use every opportunity to learn something new.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here I would like to share my own thoughts, feelings, and those things I find interesting, useful and important with all of you who have the same interests as me.
